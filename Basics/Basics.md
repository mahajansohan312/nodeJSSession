#### 1. Basics of JavaScript
An example of javascript basics, it contains details about basic of declaring variables and scope of variables - their access limitations

This example illustrate declaration of four variables - 
* firstVariable 
* secondVariable 
* thirdVariable 
* fourthVariable

Here, we can see all above variables are declared in using const,let and var. 

The **const** declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered. 

**let** statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.Variables declared by let have their scope in the block for which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very much like var. At the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object.
